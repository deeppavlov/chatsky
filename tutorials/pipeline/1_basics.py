`Pipeline` is an object, that automates script execution and context management.
`from_script` method can be used to create
a pipeline of the most basic structure:
"preprocessors -> actor -> postprocessors"
as well as to define `context_storage` and `messenger_interface`.
Actor is a component of :py:class:`.Pipeline`, that contains the :py:class:`.Script`
and handles it. It is responsible for processing user input and determining
the appropriate response based on the current state of the conversation and the script.
These parameters usage will be shown in tutorials 2, 3 and 6.

Here only required parameters are provided to pipeline.
`context_storage` will default to simple Python dict and
`messenger_interface` will never be used.
pre- and postprocessors lists are empty.
`Pipeline` object can be called with user input
as first argument and dialog id (any immutable object).
This call will return `Context`,
its `last_response` property will be actors response.
