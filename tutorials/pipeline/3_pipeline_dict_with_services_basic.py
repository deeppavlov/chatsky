# 3. Pipeline dict with services (basic)

The following tutorial shows `pipeline` creation from
dict and most important pipeline components.

Here, %mddoclink(api,core.service.service,Service)
class, that can be used for pre- and postprocessing of messages is shown.

%mddoclink(api,core.pipeline,Pipeline)'s
constructor method is used for pipeline creation (directly or from dictionary).

When Pipeline is created using it's constructor method or
Pydantic's `model_validate` method,
`Pipeline` should be defined as a dictionary of a particular structure,
which must contain `script`, `start_label` and `fallback_label`,
see `Script` tutorials.

Optional Pipeline parameters:
* `messenger_interface` - `MessengerInterface` instance,
        is used to connect to channel and transfer IO to user.
* `context_storage` - Place to store dialog contexts
        (dictionary or a `DBContextStorage` instance).
* `pre-services` - A `ServiceGroup` object,
        basically a list of `Service` objects or more `ServiceGroup` objects,
        see tutorial 4.
* `post-services` - A `ServiceGroup` object,
        basically a list of `Service` objects or more `ServiceGroup` objects,
        see tutorial 4.
* `before_handler` - a list of `ExtraHandlerFunction` objects or
        a `ComponentExtraHandler` object.
        See tutorials 6 and 7.
* `after_handler` - a list of `ExtraHandlerFunction` objects or
        a `ComponentExtraHandler` object.
        See tutorials 6 and 7.
* `timeout` - Pipeline timeout, see tutorial 5.

On pipeline execution services from
`components` = 'pre-services' + actor + 'post-services'
list are run without difference between pre- and postprocessors.
`Service` object can be defined either with callable
(see tutorial 2) or with `Service` constructor / dict.
It must contain `handler` - a callable (function).

Not only Pipeline can be run using `__call__` method,
for most cases `run` method should be used.
It starts pipeline asynchronously and connects to provided messenger interface.

Here, the pipeline contains 3 services,
defined in 3 different ways with different signatures.
