To set up a webhook, you need a messenger and a web application instance.
This class can be configured with the following parameters:

* app - Flask application. You can pass an application with an arbitrary
    number of pre-configured routes. Created automatically if not set.
* host - application host.
* port - application port.
* endpoint - bot access endpoint.
* full_uri - full public address of the endpoint. HTTPS should be enabled
    for successful configuration.
