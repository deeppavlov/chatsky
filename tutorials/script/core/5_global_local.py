"""
Keywords `GLOBAL` and `LOCAL` are used to define global and local nodes
respectively. Global node is defined at the script level (along with flows)
and local node is defined at the flow level (along with nodes inside a flow).

Every local node inherits properties from the global node.
Every node inherits properties from the local node (of its flow).

For example, if we are to set list `A` as transitions for the
local node of a flow, then every node of that flow would effectively
have the `A` list extended with its own transitions.

<div class="alert alert-info">

To sum up transition priorities:

Transition A is of higher priority compared to Transition B:

1. If A.priority > B.priority; OR
2. If A is a node transition and B is a local or global transition;
    or A is a local transition and B is a global transition; OR
3. If A is defined in the transition list earlier than B.

</div>

For more information on node inheritance, see [here](
%doclink(api,core.script,Script.get_inherited_node)
).

<div class="alert alert-info">

Note

Property %mddoclink(api,core.context,Context.current_node) does not return
the current node as is. Instead it returns a node that is modified
by the global and local nodes.
