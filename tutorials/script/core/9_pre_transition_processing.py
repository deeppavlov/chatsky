Processing functions can be used at two stages:

1. Pre-transition. Triggers after response is received but before
   the next node is considered.
2. Pre-response. Triggers after transition is chosen and current node is
   changed but before response of that node is calculated.

In this tutorial we'll save the response function of the current node
during pre-transition and extract it during pre-response
(at which point current node is already changed).

Note

Previous node can be accessed another way.

Instead of storing the node response in misc,
one can obtain previous label
with `dst.Previous()(ctx)` and then get the node from the
%mddoclink(api,core.script,Script) object:

```python
ctx.pipeline.script.get_inherited_node(dst.Previous()(ctx))
