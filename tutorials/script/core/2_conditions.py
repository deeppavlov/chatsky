# Core: 2. Conditions

This tutorial shows different options for
setting transition conditions from one node to another.

Here, [conditions](%doclink(api,conditions.standard))
for script transitions are shown.

The transition condition is determined by
%mddoclink(api,core.script_function,BaseCondition).

If this function returns `True`,
then the corresponding transition is considered possible.

Condition functions have signature

    class MyCondition(BaseCondition):
        async def call(self, ctx: Context) -> bool:

This script covers the following pre-defined conditions:

- `ExactMatch` returns `True` if the user's request completely
    matches the value passed to the function.
- `Regexp` returns `True` if the pattern matches the user's request.
    `Regexp` has same signature as `re.compile` function.
- `Any` returns `True` if one element of input sequence of conditions is `True`.
- `All` returns `True` if All elements of input
    sequence of conditions are `True`.

For a full list of available conditions see
[here](%doclink(api,conditions.standard)).

The `cnd` field of `Transition` may also be a constant bool value.

class HiLowerCase(BaseCondition):
    """
    Return True if `hi` in both uppercase and lowercase
    letters is contained in the user request.

Conditions are subclasses of `pydantic.BaseModel`.

You can define custom fields to make them more customizable:

class ComplexUserAnswer(BaseCondition):

    Checks if the misc field of the last message is of a certain value.

    Messages are more complex than just strings.
    The misc field can be used to store metadata about the message.
