# Core: 5. Global transitions

This tutorial shows the global setting of transitions.

Here, global [conditions](%doclink(api,script.conditions.std_conditions))
for default transition between many different script steps are shown.

First of all, let's do all the necessary imports from DFF.

"""
The keyword `GLOBAL` is used to define a global node.
There can be only one global node in a script.
The value that corresponds to this key has the
`dict` type with the same keywords as regular nodes.
The global node is defined above the flow level as opposed to regular nodes.
This node allows to define default global values for all nodes.

There are `GLOBAL` node and three flows:
`global_flow`, `greeting_flow`, `music_flow`.
