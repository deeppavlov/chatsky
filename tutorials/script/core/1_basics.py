# Core: 1. Basics

This notebook shows a basic example of creating a simple dialog bot (agent).

Here, basic usage of %mddoclink(api,core.pipeline,Pipeline) is shown.

Additionally, function %mddoclink(api,utils.testing.common,check_happy_path)
that can be used for Pipeline testing is presented.

Let's do all the necessary imports from Chatsky:
"""

# %pip install chatsky

# %%
from chatsky import (
    TRANSITIONS,
    RESPONSE,
    Pipeline,
    Transition as Tr,
    conditions as cnd,
    # all the aliases used in tutorials are available for direct import
    # e.g. you can do `from chatsky import Tr` instead
)

from chatsky.utils.testing.common import (
    check_happy_path,
    is_interactive_mode,
)

First of all, to create a dialog agent, we need to create a dialog script.
Below script means a dialog script.

A script is a dictionary, where the keys are the names of the flows.
A script can contain multiple scripts, which is needed in order to divide
a dialog into sub-dialogs and process them separately.

For example, the separation can be tied to the topic of the dialog.
In this tutorial there is one flow called `greeting_flow`.

Flow describes a sub-dialog using linked nodes.
Each node has the keywords `RESPONSE` and `TRANSITIONS`.

* `RESPONSE` contains the response
    that the agent will return from the current node.
* `TRANSITIONS` is a list of %mddoclink(api,core.transition,Transition)s
    that describes possible transitions from the current node as well as their
    conditions and priorities.

`Pipeline` is an object that processes user
inputs and produces responses.

To create the pipeline you need to pass the script (`script`),
initial node (`start_label`) and
the node to which the default transition will take place
if none of the current conditions are met (`fallback_label`).

If `fallback_label` is not set, it defaults to `start_label`.

Roughly, the process is as follows:

1. Pipeline receives a user request.
2. The next node is determined with the help of `TRANSITIONS`.
3. Response of the chosen node is sent to the user.

For a more detailed description, see [here](
%doclink(api,core.pipeline,Pipeline._run_pipeline)
).
