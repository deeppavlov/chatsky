# Core: 4. Transitions

This tutorial shows settings for transitions between flows and nodes.

Here, [conditions](%doclink(api,conditions.standard))
for transition between many different script steps are shown.

Some of the destination steps can be set using
[destinations](%doclink(api,destinations.standard)).

"""
The `TRANSITIONS` keyword is used to determine a list of transitions from
the current node. After receiving user request, Pipeline will choose the
next node relying on that list.
If no transition in the list is suitable, transition will be made
to the fallback node.

Each transition is represented by the %mddoclink(api,core.transition,Transition)
class.

It has three main fields:

- dst: Destination determines the node to which the transition is made.
- cnd: Condition determines if the transition is allowed.
- priority: Allows choosing one of the transitions if several are allowed.
    Higher priority transitions will be chosen over the rest.
    If priority is not set,
    %mddoclink(api,core.pipeline,Pipeline.default_priority)
    is used instead.
    Default priority is 1 by default (but may be set via Pipeline).

For more details on how the next node is chosen see
[here](%doclink(api,core.transition,get_next_label)).

Like conditions, all of these fields can be either constant values or
custom functions (%mddoclink(api,core.script_function,BaseDestination),
%mddoclink(api,core.script_function,BaseCondition),
%mddoclink(api,core.script_function,BasePriority)).
"""

# %% [markdown]
"""
## Destinations

Destination node is specified with a %mddoclink(api,core.node_label,NodeLabel)
class.

It contains two field:

- "flow_name": Name of the flow the node belongs to.
    Optional; if not set, will use the flow of the current node.
- "node_name": Name of the node inside the flow.

Instances of this class can be initialized from a tuple of two strings
(flow name and node name) or a single string (node name; relative flow name).
This happens automatically for return values of `BaseDestination`
and for the `dst` field of `Transition`.

"""
Chatsky provides several basic transitions as part of
the %mddoclink(api,destinations.standard) module:

- `FromHistory` returns a node from label history.
    `Current` and `Previous` are subclasses of it that return specific nodes
    (current node and previous node respectively).
- `Start` returns the start node.
- `Fallback` returns the fallback node.
- `Forward` returns the next node (in order of definition)
    in the current flow relative to the current node.
- `Backward` returns the previous node (in order of definition)
    in the current flow relative to the current node.
