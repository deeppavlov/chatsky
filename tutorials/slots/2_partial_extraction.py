## Extracted values

Result of successful slot extraction is the extracted value, *but*
if the extraction fails, the slot will be marked as "not extracted"
and its value will be set to the slot's `default_value` (`None` by default).

If group slot is being extracted, the extraction is considered successful
if and only if all child slots are successfully extracted.

## Success only extraction

The `Extract` function accepts `success_only` flag which makes it so
that extracted value is not saved unless extraction is successful.

This means that unsuccessfully trying to extract a slot will not overwrite
its previously extracted value.

Note that `success_only` is `True` by default.

## Partial group slot extraction

A group slot marked with `allow_partial_extraction` only saves values
of successfully extracted child slots.
Extracting such group slot is equivalent to extracting every child slot
with the `success_only` flag.

Partially extracted group slot is always considered successfully extracted
for the purposes of the `success_only` flag.

## Code explanation

In this example we showcase the behavior of
different group slot extraction settings:

Group `partial_extraction` is marked with `allow_partial_extraction`.
Any slot in this group is saved if and only if that slot is successfully
extracted.

Group `success_only_extraction` is extracted with the `success_only`
flag set to True.
Any slot in this group is saved if and only if all of the slots in the group
are successfully extracted within a single `Extract` call.

Group `success_only_false` is extracted with the `success_only` set to False.
Every slot in this group is saved (even if extraction was not successful).

Group `sub_slot_success_only_extraction` is extracted by passing all of its
child slots to the `Extract` method with the `success_only` flag set to True.
The behavior is equivalent to that of `partial_extraction`.
