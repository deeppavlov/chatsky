# 2. Form Example

The following tutorial shows the way you can utilize the `FormPolicy` class
to enhance the dialog with a greedy form-filling strategy.

from dff.script import (

    TRANSITIONS,
    PRE_TRANSITIONS_PROCESSING,

"""
As an initial step, all the slots that belong to the form need to be instantiated.
"""
# %%
restaurant_cuisine = slots.RegexpSlot(
    name="cuisine", regexp=r"([A-Za-z]+) cuisine", match_group_idx=1
)
restaurant_address = slots.RegexpSlot(
    name="restaurantaddress", regexp=r"(at|in) (.+)", match_group_idx=2
)
number_of_people = slots.RegexpSlot(name="numberofpeople", regexp=r"[0-9]+")
# %% [markdown]
"""
Secondly, the ``FormPolicy`` object is instantiated where slot names are
mapped to node names. This allows the form component to manage
the dialog ensuring that the user traverses the nodes used for slot extraction.

Slots will be iterated in order to determine the next transition.
If none is possible, the form policy will suggest a fallback transition.

"""
# %%
restaurant_form = slots.FormPolicy(
    "restaurant",
    {
        restaurant_cuisine.name: ("restaurant", "cuisine"),
        restaurant_address.name: ("restaurant", "address"),
        number_of_people.name: ("restaurant", "number"),
    },
)

# %% [markdown]
"""
Thirdly, `to_next_label` method of the form object is used globally in the script
which leads to the relevant condition being checked at every dialog turn.
If the condition is met, the policy will suggest a transition to one of the
nodes from the mapping.

Priority float number is used for the condition to take precedence in cases
when multiple transition options are possible.
