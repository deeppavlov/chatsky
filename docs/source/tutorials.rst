Tutorials
---------
Tutorials page is a collection of instructional materials designed to help developers learn
how to use DFF to build conversational agents. The tutorials cover a range of topics,
from getting started with DFF to more advanced topics such as integrating external APIs.
Each tutorial includes detailed explanations and code examples. Tutorials cover different aspects
of the framework and are organized into sections.

The Context Storages section describes how to use context storages in DFF.
The Messengers section covers how to use the Telegram messenger with DFF.
The Pipeline section teaches the basics of the pipeline concept, how to use pre- and postprocessors,
asynchronous groups and services, custom messenger interfaces, and extra handlers and extensions.
The Script section covers the basics of the script concept, including conditions, responses, transitions,
and serialization. It also includes tutorials on pre-response and pre-transitions processing.
Finally, the Utils section covers the cache and LRU cache utilities in DFF.

The main difference between Tutorials and Examples is that Tutorials typically show how to implement
a specific feature or solve a particular problem, whereas Examples provide a more
comprehensive overview of how to build a complete application.
