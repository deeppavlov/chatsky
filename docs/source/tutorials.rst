Tutorials
---------
Tutorials page is a collection of instructional materials designed to help developers learn
how to use Chatsky to build conversational agents. The tutorials cover a range of topics,
from getting started with Chatsky to more advanced topics such as integrating external APIs.
Each tutorial includes detailed explanations and code examples. Tutorials cover different aspects
of the framework and are organized into sections.

The Context Storages section describes how to use context storages in Chatsky.

The Messengers section covers how to use the Telegram messenger with Chatsky and how to create web interface.

The Service section teaches how to use Services: objects that execute
before or after the main part.

The Script section covers the basics of the script concept, including conditions, responses, transitions,
and serialization. It also includes tutorials on pre-response and pre-transition processing.

The main difference between Tutorials and Examples is that Tutorials typically show how to implement
a specific feature or solve a particular problem, whereas Examples provide a more
comprehensive overview of how to build a complete application.
