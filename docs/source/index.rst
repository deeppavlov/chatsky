The Dialog Flow Framework (DFF) is an open-source, `Apache 2.0 <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_-licensed library
that was developed specifically for creating dialog systems. DFF provides a comprehensive set of tools and resources for building conversational systems
for a wide range of applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and other interactive systems.
It allows developers to easily create and manage complex dialog flows, integrate with natural language processing (NLP) tools,
and handle user input in a flexible and efficient manner. Additionally, the framework is highly customizable,
allowing developers to easily adapt it to their specific needs and requirements.
