Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Context is a data structure that is used to store information about the current state of a conversation.
It is used to keep track of the user's input, the current stage of the conversation, and any other
information that is relevant to the current context of a dialog.
The Context provides a convenient interface for working with data, allowing developers to easily add,
retrieve, and manipulate data as the conversation progresses.

Another important feature of the context is data serialization.
The context can be easily serialized to a format that can be stored or transmitted, such as JSON.
