    "## Component paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Each component has a unique path that can be used as an ID for that component.\n",
    "\n",
    "A path of a component is a \".\" concatenation of names of service groups this\n",
    "component is in and the name of this component.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if component \"c\" is in group \"b\" which itself is in group \"a\"\n",
    "then path of \"c\" is \"a.b.c\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Naming services\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing a name for a component, keep in mind that\n",
    "it should be unique among other components in the same service group.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computed names\n",
    "\n",
    "If a component does not have a name, one is provided to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each component has `computed_name` property which returns a default name.\n",
    "    All service groups have \"service_group\" as their computed name.\n",
    "    For services the computed name is the name of the handler **or** of the\n",
    "    service class if handler is not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "    E.g. A service with handler `my_func` has computed name \"my_func\";\n",
    "    and if service `MyService` is a subclass of `Service` and does not\n",
    "    define `handler` its computed name is \"MyService\".\n",
    "2. If there are two or more components in a service group with the same\n",
    "    computed name, they are assigned names with an incrementing postfix.\n",
    "    For example, if there are two service groups with no name in pre-services\n",
    "    they will be named \"service_group#0\" and \"service_group#1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Names of basic components\n",
    "\n",
    "* Main component (pipeline) has an empty name;\n",
    "* Name of the pre services group is \"pre\";\n",
    "* Name of the post services group is \"post\";\n",
    "* Name of the actor service is \"actor\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have `pre_services=[my_func]`, the full path of the\n",
    "`my_func` component is \".pre.my_func\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Component start condition\n",
    "\n",
    "Any component (service or service group) can have a `start_condition`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start condition is a `BaseCondition` that determines whether the component\n",
    "should be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about conditions, see the [condition tutorial](\n",
    "../tutorials/tutorials.script.core.2_conditions.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Component status\n",
    "\n",
    "At any time each component has a certain status:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `NOT_RUN` - Component hasn't bee executed yet or\n",
    "    start condition returned False.\n",
    "* `RUNNING` - Component is currently being executed.\n",
    "* `FINISHED` - Component finished successfully.\n",
    "* `FAILED` - Component execution failed.\n",

    "For more information, see\n",

    "\n",
    "### ServiceFinished condition\n",
    "\n",
    "`ServiceFinished` is a condition that returns `True` if another service\n",
    "has the `FINISHED` status.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ServiceFinished` accepts the following constructor parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `path` (required) - a path of another component.\n",
    "* `wait` - whether it should wait for the component to complete.\n",
    "    This means that the component status cannot be\n",
    "    `NOT_RUN` or `RUNNING` at the time of the check.\n",
    "    Defaults to `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It is possible for the pipeline to get stuck in infinite waiting\n",
    "with the `ServiceFinished` condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Either disable `wait` or set a timeout for the service.\n",

    "## Code explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, two conditionally executed services are illustrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The service named `running_service` is executed\n",
    "only if both `SimpleServices` in pre service group\n",
    "have finished successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "`never_running_service` is executed only if `running_service` is not finished,\n",
    "which should never happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, `context_printing_service` prints pipeline runtime information,\n",
    "that contains execution state of all previously run services."
