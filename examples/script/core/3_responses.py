The response can be set by any object of python:

* Callable objects. If the object is callable it must have a special signature:

        func(ctx: Context, actor: Actor, *args, **kwargs) -> Any

* Non-callable objects. If the object is not callable,
    it will be returned by the agent as a response.

Out of the box `DSL` has a single response function `choice`
that gives one random response from the list of responses.

The functions to be used in the `toy_script` are declared here.
