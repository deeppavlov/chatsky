# 2. Conditions

This example shows different options for
setting transition conditions from one node to another.
First of all, let's do all the necessary imports from `dff`.

"""
The transition condition is set by the function.
If this function returns the value `True`,
then the actor performs the corresponding transition.
Condition functions have signature

    def func(ctx: Context, actor: Actor, *args, **kwargs) -> bool

Out of the box `dff.core.engine` offers the
    following options for setting conditions:

* `exact_match` returns `True` if the user's request completely
    matches the value passed to the function.
* `regexp` returns `True` if the pattern matches the user's request,
    while the user's request must be a string.
    `regexp` has same signature as `re.compile` function.
* `aggregate` returns `bool` value as
    a result after aggregate by `aggregate_func`
    for input sequence of condtions.
    `aggregate_func == any` by default. `aggregate` has alias `agg`.
* `any` returns `True` if one element of input sequence of condtions is `True`.
    `any(input_sequence)` is equivalent to
    `aggregate(input sequence, aggregate_func=any)`.
* `all` returns `True` if all elements of input
    sequence of condtions are `True`.
    `all(input_sequence)` is equivalent to
    `aggregate(input sequence, aggregate_func=all)`.
* `negation` returns negation of passed function. `negation` has alias `neg`.
* `has_last_labels` covered in the following examples.
* `true` returns `True`.
* `false` returns `False`.

For example function
```
def always_true_condition(ctx: Context, actor: Actor, *args, **kwargs) -> bool:
    return True
```
always returns `True` and `always_true_condition` function
is the same as `dff.core.engine.conditions.true()`.

The functions to be used in the `toy_script` are declared here.
