Groups and conditions (full)

Pipeline can contain not only single services, but also service groups.
Service groups can be defined as lists of ServiceBuilders
            (in fact, all of the pipeline services are combined into root service group named "pipeline").
Alternatively, the groups can be defined as objects with following constructor arguments:
    `components` (required) - a list of ServiceBuilder objects, ServiceGroup objects and lists of them
    `wrappers` - a list of pipeline wrappers, see example №7
    `timeout` - pipeline timeout, see example №5
    `asynchronous` - whether or not this service group _should_ be asynchronous
                (keep in mind that not all service groups _can_ be asynchronous), see example №5
    `start_condition` - service group start condition
    `name` - custom defined name for the service group (keep in mind that names in one ServiceGroup should be unique)
Service (and service group) object fields are mostly the same as constructor parameters,
            however there are some differences:
    `requested_async_flag` - contains the value received from `asynchronous` constructor parameter
    `calculated_async_flag` - contains automatically calculated possibility of the service to be asynchronous
    `asynchronous` - combination af `..._async_flag` fields,
                requested value overrides calculated (if not None), see example №5
    `path` - contains globally unique (for pipeline) path to the service or service group

If no name is specified for a service or service group, the name will be generated according to the following rules:
    1. If service's handler is an Actor, service will be named 'actor'
    2. If service's handler is an callable, service will be named after that callable
    3. Service group will be named 'service_group'
    4. Otherwise, it will be named 'noname_service'
    5. After that an index will be added to service name

To receive serialized information about service, service group or pipeline a property `info_dict`
            can be used, it returns important object properties as a dict.
In addition to that `pretty_format` method of Pipeline can be used to get all pipeline
            properties as a formatted string (e.g. for logging or debugging purposes).

Services and service groups can be executed conditionally.
            Conditions are functions passed to `start_condition` argument.
These functions should have following signature: (ctx: Context, actor: Actor) -> bool.
            Service is only executed if its start_condition returned True.
By default all the services start unconditionally.
            There are number of built-in condition functions as well as possibility to create custom ones.
Custom condition functions can rely on data in `ctx.misc` as well as on any external data source.
Built-in condition functions check other service states.
            All of the services store their execution status in context, this status can be one of the following:
    `NOT_RUN` - service hasn't bee executed yet
    `RUNNING` - service is currently being executed (important for asynchronous services)
    `FINISHED` - service finished successfully
    `FAILED` - service execution failed (that also throws an exception)
There are following built-in condition functions:
    `always_start_condition` - default condition function, always starts service
    `service_successful_condition(path)` - function that checks, whether service with given `path`
                executed successfully (is `FINISHED`)
    `not_condition(function)` - function that returns result opposite from the one returned by the `function`
                (condition function) argument
    `aggregate_condition(aggregator, *functions)` - function that aggregated results of numerous `functions`
                (condition functions) using special `aggregator` function
    `all_condition(*functions)` - function that returns True only if all of the given `functions`
                (condition functions) return True
    `any_condition(*functions)` - function that returns True if any of the given `functions`
                (condition functions) return True
NB! Actor service ALWAYS runs unconditionally.

Here there are two conditionally executed services: a service named `running_service`
            is executed only if both `simple_services` in `service_group_0` are finished successfully.
`never_running_service` is executed only if `running_service` is not finished, this should never happen.
`context_printing_service` prints pipeline runtime information,
            that contains execution state of all previously run services.
