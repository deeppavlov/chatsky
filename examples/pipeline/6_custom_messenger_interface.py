Messenger interfaces are used for providing a way for communication between user and pipeline.
They manage message channel initialization and termination as well as pipeline execution on every user request.
There are two built-in messenger interface types (that may be overridden):
    `PollingMessengerInterface` - starts polling for user request in a loop upon initialization,
                                  it has following methods:
        `_request()` - method that is executed in a loop, should return list of tuples: (user request, unique dialog id)
        `_respond(responses)` - method that is executed in a loop after all user requests processing,
                                accepts list of dialog Contexts
        `_on_exception(e)` - method that is called on exception that happens in the loop,
                             should catch the exception (it is also called on pipeline termination)
        `connect(pipeline_runner, loop, timeout)` - method that is called on connection to message channel,
                                                    accepts pipeline_runner (a callback, running pipeline)
            loop - a function to be called on each loop execution (should return True to continue polling)
            timeout - time in seconds to wait between loop executions
    `CallbackMessengerInterface` - creates message channel and provides a callback for pipeline execution,
                                   it has following methods:
        `on_request(request, ctx_id)` - method that should be called each time user provides new input to pipeline,
                                        returns dialog Context
`CLIMessengerInterface` is also a messenger interface that overrides `PollingMessengerInterface` and
    provides default message channel between pipeline and console/file IO

Here a default `CallbackMessengerInterface` is used to setup communication between pipeline and Flask server.
Two services are used to process request:
    `purify_request` extracts user request from Flask HTTP request
    `construct_webpage_by_response` wraps actor response in webpage and adds response-based image to it
