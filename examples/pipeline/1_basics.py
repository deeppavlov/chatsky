`Pipeline` is an object, that automates `Actor` execution and context management.
`from_script` method can be used to create
a pipeline of the most basic structure:
"preprocessors -> actor -> postprocessors"
as well as to define `context_storage` and `messenger_interface`.
These parameters usage will be shown in examples 2, 3 and 6.

Here only required for Actor creating parameters are provided to pipeline.
`context_storage` will default to simple Python dict and
`messenger_interface` will never be used.
pre- and postprocessors lists are empty.
`Pipeline` object can be called with user input
as first argument and dialog id (any immutable object).
This call will return `Context`,
its `last_response` property will be actors response.
