# DFF example projects

This directory contains examples of bots built using [DFF](https://github.com/deeppavlov/dialog_flow_framework) (Dialog Flow Framework).

The example projects include a FAQ bot for potential Linux users and a customer service bot for a book shop. Both bots use Telegram as an interface.
