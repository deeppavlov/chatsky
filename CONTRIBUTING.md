## Introduction
We will be glad to receive your pull requests (PRs) and issues for adding new features if you are missing something.
We always look forward to your contributions to the Dialog Flow Framework (DFF). 

## Rules for submitting a PR

All PRs are reviewed by DFF developers team.
In order to make the job of reviewing easier and increase the chance that your PR will be accepted,
please add a short description with information about why this PR is needed and what changes will be made.
Please use the following rules to write the names of branches and commit messages.

### Rules for writing names of branches

We hope that you adhere to the following
[format](https://gist.github.com/seunggabi/87f8c722d35cd07deb3f649d45a31082).

### Commit message rules

We ask that you adhere to the following
[commit message format](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716).

## Managing your workflow
We use `make` as handy automation tool, which reads `makefile` to get specification for commands.
`make` is a tool for command running automatization. Usage signature of the `make` is `make COMMAND`.
If your environment supports `make` autocompletions you can use Tab to complete the `COMMAND`.

### Platforms

We suggest using a linux-based platform for addon development.
While the repository can be cloned to any platforms that can run `python`,
the `make` and `docker` functionality will not be available for Windows out of the box.

### Virtual Environment
The most essential part is setting up the virtual environment.
The following command create `venv` dir and installs all the dependencies, which are required for development.
```bash
make venv
```

If you need to update the dependencies, run
```bash
make clean && make venv
```

Do not forget to activate the environment, if you aim to install any other dependencies.
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Pre-commit
We also provide a simple pre-commit hook for `git` that prevents you from committing unformatted code. To use it, run
```bash
make pre_commit
```

### Documentation
Assuming you use [reStructuredText (reST) format docstrings](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html)
to annotate your modules and objects. You can easily build the Sphinx documentation for your module 
by activating the virtual environment and then running

```bash
make doc
```

After that `docs/build` dir will be created and you can open index file `docs/build/index.html` in your browser of choice.  
WARNING! Because of the current patching solution, `make doc` modifies some of the source library code (`nbsphinx` and `autosummary`),
so it is strongly advised to use it carefully and in virtual environment only.
However, this behavior is likely to be changed in the future.

#### Documentation links

In your tutorials, you can use special expanding directives in markdown cells.
They can help shorten the comments and avoid boilerplate code.
The documentation links generated by the directives are always relative
to the local documentation and verified during build.

- `%pip install {args}`
    This directive generates dependency installation cell, adds a comment and sets up "quiet" flag.
  
    It should be used in tutorials, like this: `# %pip install dff[...]`.
- `%doclink({args})`
    This directive generates a documentation link. It supports 2 or three arguments and the generated link will look like: `ARG1/ARG2#ARG3`.
    
    The first argument can be either `api` for DFF codebase, `tutorial` for tutorials or `guide` for user guides.
- `%mddoclink({args})`
    This directive is a shortcut for `%doclink` that generates a markdown format link instead.
    
    The generated link will be either `[ARG2](%doclink(ARG1,ARG2))` or `[ARG3](%doclink(ARG1,ARG2,ARG3))`.

### Style
For style supporting we propose `black`, which is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter.
It doesn't take previous formatting into account. See more about [black](https://github.com/psf/black). 
To format your code, run

```bash
make format
```

### Test
We use `black`, `mypy`, `flake8` as code style checkers and `pytest` as unit-test runner.
To run unit-tests only, use
```bash
make test
```
To execute all tests, including integration with DBs and APIs tests, run
```bash
make test_all
```
for successful execution of this command `Docker` and `docker compose` are required.

To make sure that the code satisfies only the style requirements, run
```bash
make lint
```
And if it doesn't, to automatically fix whatever is possible with `black`, run
```bash
make format
```

Tests are configured via [`.env_file`](.env_file).

### Docker
DFF uses docker images for two purposes:
1. Database images for integration testing.
2. Images for statistics collection.

The first group can be launched via

```bash
docker compose --profile context_storage up
```

This will download and run all the databases (`mysql`, `postgres`, `redis`, `mongo`, `ydb`).

The second group can be launched via

```bash
docker compose --profile stats up
```

This will download and launch Superset Dashboard, Clickhouse, OpenTelemetry Collector.

To launch both groups run
```bash
docker compose --profile context_storage --profile stats up
```
or
```bash
make docker_up
```

This will be done automatically when running `make test_all`.

### Other provided features 
You can get more info about `make` commands by `help`:

```bash
make help
```
